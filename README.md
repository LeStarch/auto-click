# Auto Clicker
An autoclicker.  Made to guarentee the source does not have malware like cretain popular clickers off the internet.

**Note:** This project is on-going work and is not quite complete.

--Made for a Friend--

## Purpose

The purpose of this code is to be a cross-platform auto-clicking program. Most of these auto-clickers on the internet steal user infomation, perform key-logging, or other quasi-evil activities. Thus, I rolled a solution for a friend.
